                            Ashley was born in Hamilton, Ontario and adopted by the Moras Family. She grew up in
                            Oakville
                            with 3 siblings, an older sister and younger brother, also adopted, and a younger sister,
                            who is her
                            parents'biological child.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            At a young age, Ashley discovered a love of dance and began her professional training to
                            become
                            a ballet dancer at the age of 10. She trained professionally for over 8 years, attending
                            the exclusive
                            Summer Dance Program as part of the Banff Arts Festival, for 4 summers in a row.

                            When she was 21, Ashley began her search for her biological parents. Although she grew up
                            in a
                            wonderful family, she has always been curious to know where she came from. She received her
                            information
                            from the Government of Ontario and discovered that her birth mother's name was Kim and was
                            about to trun
                            18 years old when Ashley was born. After a lot of research she was able to contact her
                            biological aunts,
                            only to discover that Kim was not ready to meet or interact with Ashley.
